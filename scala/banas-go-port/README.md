Porting the examples from this [intro-to-go-syntax
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF9S4QZuV30) to Scala.

I think this is a very important comment on the video:

> Most languages used today are C like.
> Experienced developer needs couple of hours to learn a language on a shallow level.

Basically, this is just syntax with a very quick introduction to a few more
powerful things like recursion and goroutines.

Regardless, I thought it would be fun to do a quick port to Scala.  I had a
thought to do this while thinking about the niceness of expression-based
languages and wondering how goroutines are different from actors.
